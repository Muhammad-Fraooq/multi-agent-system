# 🤖 Welcome to the Multi-Agent System by Muhammad Farooq! 🚀

Hi there, User! 👋  
This is an intelligent multi-agent system built with Chainlit, designed to demonstrate how different AI agents can work together to solve complex tasks interactively.

## 🧠 What Can This App Do?

- ✅ Respond to user queries using LLM-powered agents
- 🌦️ Get live weather updates using the Weather Agent
- 🧾 Maintain context-aware conversations (Memory feature coming soon!)
- 🧩 Modular architecture using the OpenAI Agents SDK (student-friendly workaround)

## 💡 How to Use

Just type a message in the chat! Try:
- `"What's the weather in Lahore?"`
- `"Summarize this text:"` and paste some content
- `"Help me plan a study schedule"`

More advanced agent workflows will be available soon!
